The Zoul module is a ready-to-integrate solution for IoT applications and products, providing a significant reduction in development and certification costs, and a quicker time-to-market. It combines the CC2538 System-on-Chip and CC1200 sub-1GHz radio interface in a single module format for fast reuse in different formats and form-factors, with a competitive market price.

The Zoul offers deep sleep support with RAM retention for ultra-low energy consumption, and native USB support (CDC-ACM) and SLIP over UART for improved border router performance. The module also supports DMA transfers for increased performance, making data transfers between RAM and RF, and RAM and USB, faster.

The CC2538 System-on-Chip includes a range of hardware support, including standard Cortex M3 peripherals (NVIC, SCB, SysTick), sleep timer, SysTick, RF (2.4GHz), UART, watchdog, USB, uDMA controller, random number generator, low power modes, and general-purpose timers. The CC2538 also features an ADC, cryptoprocessor with AES-ECB/CBC/CTR/CBC-MAC/GCM/CCM-128/192/256 and SHA-256, public key accelerator, flash-based port of Coffee, PWM, LEDs, buttons, and built-in core temperature and battery sensor.

The Zoul module provides a comprehensive and flexible hardware solution for IoT applications and products, making it a valuable investment for companies looking to upgrade to an IoT-connected solution.

Both the Zolertia Firefly and the RE-Mote are using the zoul module.

The RE-Mote is a lightweight and powerful IoT hardware development platform that allows for seamless connectivity for indoor and outdoor applications. It features a multiband antenna for easy data transmission and a double radio interface for both short and long range connectivity. The device is small and industry-certified, and has ultra low-power operation for long battery life. It comes equipped with a built-in battery charger and can be powered from 3-28V. It also includes a micro-SD card for easy data storage and retrieval and is compatible with popular platforms such as Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, and Intel Edison. It is supported by Contiki, RIOT, OpenWSN, and Texas Instruments.
